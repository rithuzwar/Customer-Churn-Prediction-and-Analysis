# Customer Churn Prediction and Analysis

## Problem Statement
Predict which customers are likely to leave a bank (churn) and analyze key patterns behind customer attrition.

## Solution Approach
- **Data Cleaning**: Removed unnecessary columns, handled missing values.
- **Data Balancing**: Used SMOTE to handle imbalanced classes.
- **Modeling**: Trained XGBoost classifier with scaled features.
- **Prediction**: Predicted churn risk and probability scores.
- **Visualization**: Built an interactive Power BI dashboard showing key churn insights.

## Key Visualizations
- KPI Cards (Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score)
- Churn by Geography
- Churn by Age Group
- Churn by Balance Range
- High Risk Customers Segmentation Table
- Churn Probability Heatmap

## Tech Stack
- Python (Pandas, Scikit-Learn, Imblearn, XGBoost)
- Power BI (Dashboarding)
- GitHub (Version Control)
